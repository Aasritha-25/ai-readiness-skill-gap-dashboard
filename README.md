🧠 AI Readiness & Skill Gap Analysis Dashboard

A Decision-Focused Data Analytics Project

📌 Project Summary

This project examines AI readiness and skill gaps among data professionals, with a particular focus on recent graduates, utilizing a Power BI dashboard and structured analysis.

The goal is not just to visualize data, but to answer a decision question:

“Where should organizations focus their AI upskilling efforts?”

🎯 Why This Project Matters

As AI becomes integral to data roles, companies face challenges such as:

Freshers listing core tools (SQL, Excel) but lacking AI exposure

No clear metric to measure AI preparedness

Difficulty identifying which skills to train first

This project bridges that gap using data-driven insights.

🧩 Problem Statement

Organizations need to understand:

How AI-ready are candidates across data roles?

What are the most common skill gaps among freshers?

Which roles require immediate AI upskilling?

Without structured analysis, these decisions are often based on assumptions.

✅ Solution Approach

This project:

Creates an AI readiness score for candidates

Compares readiness across roles and experience levels

Identifies the top missing skills among freshers

Presents insights through a clean Power BI dashboard
